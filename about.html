           <article>
            <p>My name is Erica Gee, and I am 24 years old. I have been studying at Eastern Washignton Univeristy for the past two and a half years and will be graduating with a Bachelors in Marketing with a minor in Visual Communication Design (graphic design) in June of 2016. I've dabbled in many different majors, as I could not pick one early on in my college career. I've had experience with accounting, general business, graphic design, fashion design, and advanced math. </p>
            <p>The ideal career for me would involve designing advertisements like I do in my current job as the grahpic designer for the advertising department of the schools newspaper: the Easterner. I've designed over 30 advertisements for various business in the Cheney/Spokane area for the newspaper, a few of which I have included in my portfolio.</p>

    <p>I am an avid reader and love anything and everything related to the fantasy genre. I also enjoy science fiction, cheesy romance, anime, graphic novels, and Shakespeare. My all time favorite brand, franchise, book, and movie is Alice in Wonderland. I have a tendency to incorporate Alice in Wonderland themes into my personal work whenever possible.</p>
